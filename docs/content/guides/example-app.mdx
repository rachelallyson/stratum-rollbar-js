# Example app

A runnable demo lives in `src/example/` in the package repo. It uses the same pattern: catalog, Stratum service with Rollbar plugin, and a small React UI to identify/clear person and send events at different log levels.

## Run locally

1. **Clone and install**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rachelallyson/stratum-rollbar-js.git
   cd stratum-rollbar-js
   npm install
   ```

2. **Add your token**

   Create a `.env` file in the package root (same folder as `package.json`). Use your Rollbar **post client item** token:

   ```bash
   ROLLBAR_CLIENT_TOKEN=your-post-client-item-token
   ```

   Use no quotes so the value is inlined correctly. See `.env.example` for reference.

3. **Start the example**

   ```bash
   npm run example
   ```

   This generates env into the build and starts Parcel. Open the URL Parcel prints (e.g. `http://localhost:1234`).

## What you can do

- **Status** — See whether Rollbar is "Available" and the "Last action" (e.g. LOADED sent).
- **Login / Logout** — Sends IDENTIFY and CLEAR_PERSON so Rollbar associates or clears the person.
- **Event buttons** — Send info (button click), warning, error (message), error with stack, and debug. Each updates "Last action" to show that the event was sent.

If you don't set a valid token, a yellow banner explains that events won't appear in your Rollbar project until you set `ROLLBAR_CLIENT_TOKEN`.

## E2E tests

Playwright E2E tests exercise the example app: load, status, all event buttons, login/logout, and one test that verifies the browser sends the correct payload to Rollbar's API and that Rollbar responds with 200 and a UUID (server accepted the data).

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

The tests start the example server on port 3967 and run in Chromium. They require a valid token in `.env` for the "sends event payload to Rollbar API and server accepts it" test.
