# Installation

The plugin works in any JavaScript environment (Node, browser, Next.js, Vite, Express, etc.). Next.js and React are not required.

## 1. Install the package

```bash
npm install @rachelallyson/stratum-rollbar-js
```

All commands in this documentation use **npm**. The plugin depends on [Stratum Observability](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@capitalone/stratum-observability) and the [Rollbar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollbar) SDK; they are installed automatically.

## 2. Get Rollbar tokens

In your [Rollbar project](https://rollbar.com), open **Settings → Project Access Tokens**. You need:

- **Post client item** — for browser/client-side events. Safe to expose in the client (e.g. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`).
- **Post server item** — for Node.js (Next.js server, API routes). Keep this server-only; do not put it in a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` env var.

For a single-runtime app (only browser or only Node), one token is enough.

## 3. Add tokens to your app

**Next.js (browser + server):**

In `.env` or `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROLLBAR_CLIENT_TOKEN=<your-post-client-item-token>
ROLLBAR_SERVER_TOKEN=<your-post-server-item-token>
```

**Other apps:** set `ROLLBAR_CLIENT_TOKEN` and/or `ROLLBAR_SERVER_TOKEN` (or a single `ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN`) in your environment.
